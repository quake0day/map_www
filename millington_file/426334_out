 GRWAVE COMPUTES FIELD STRENGTH-DISTANCE VARIATIONS
 FOR A HOMOGENEOUS CURVED EARTH WITH EXPONENTIALLY
 DECREASING REFRACTIVE INDEX


                     ATMOSPHERIC CONSTANTS
                         REFRACTIVITY =315.00  (N-UNITS)
                         SCALE HEIGHT = 7.350  KM

                     GROUND CONSTANTS
                         RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY =     8.550
                         CONDUCTIVITY =5.0000D-03  SIEMENS/METRE

                     VERTICAL POLARISATION

                     MINIMUM DISTANCE =   201.398  KILOMETRES
                     MAXIMUM DISTANCE =   202.398  KILOMETRES
                     DSTEP            =    10.000  KILOMETRES

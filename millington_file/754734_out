 GRWAVE COMPUTES FIELD STRENGTH-DISTANCE VARIATIONS
 FOR A HOMOGENEOUS CURVED EARTH WITH EXPONENTIALLY
 DECREASING REFRACTIVE INDEX


                     ATMOSPHERIC CONSTANTS
                         REFRACTIVITY =315.00  (N-UNITS)
                         SCALE HEIGHT = 7.350  KM

                     GROUND CONSTANTS
                         RELATIVE PERMITTIVITY =    10.772
                         CONDUCTIVITY =1.0000D-02  SIEMENS/METRE

                     MINIMUM DISTANCE =    98.594  KILOMETRES
                     MAXIMUM DISTANCE =    99.594  KILOMETRES
                     DSTEP            =    10.000  KILOMETRES
